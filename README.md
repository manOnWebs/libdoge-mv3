Doge is licensed under the [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license because, well, Doge *willed* it so. 

Much freedom.
You are free to share and remix Doge to your heart’s content—as long as you give proper credit and release any new, evolved (or otherwise) Doges under the same license. If you switch it to another license...
### ***you will go to hell before you die.***

what is this?
---------------

This is a port of the [libdoge chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/libdoge/ifbchccfedjkkhlnffjckaghjdpchhmo?hl=en) to Manifest Version 3... because of the original developer abandoning the project and not having it updated at all.

Most of the actual code for libdoge is unchanged; all that was added is the service worker so that it's compatible with MV3.

You can check the JavaScript if you don't believe me.

This doge lives [here](https://github.com/manOnWebs/libdoge).
or, the original [here](https://github.com/ljalonen/libdoge).
